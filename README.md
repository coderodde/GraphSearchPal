An experimental/research GUI application for demonstrating pathfinding algorithms.

My aim is to come up with a definitive collection of pathfinding algorithms + minimum priority queue implementations and put them all under a single GUI application. The app allows users to draw their maze, set up the source/target nodes and choose the algorithm/heap combination after which the progress is displayed in real-time.

### Pathfinding algorithms
- [x] Dijkstra's algorithm
- [x] Bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithm
- [x] A*

### Priority queues 

- [x] `BinomialHeap`
- [x] `DaryHeap`: this is the generalization of a binary heap (`d = 2`) that allows `d` children for each element in the heap.
- [x] `FibonacciHeap`
- [x] `PairingHeap`
